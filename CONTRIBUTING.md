## Types of Contributions
### Bug Reports
If you find a bug, please open an issue and tag it with `bug`. The issue should include:
- your operating system name and version,
- GATree version or commit hash,
- a short, descriptive title,
- steps required to reproduce the bug, and
- details about your local environment that might be helpful in troubleshooting the issue (e.g. Python version, etc.).

Please use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) when posting Python stack traces to improve readability.

### Feature Requests
If you'd like to request a new feature, please open an issue and tag it with `enhancement`. The issue should:
- explain the new functionality in detail,
- provide a use case for the new functionality, and
- keep the scope as narrow as possible.

### Bug Fixes
Look through the GitHub issues. Issues tagged with `bug` are open to whoever wants to implement them.

### Feature Implementation
Look through the GitHub issues. Issues tagged with `enhancement` are open to whoever wants to implement them.

### Documentation
GATree could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official GATree docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.

## Pull Request Guidelines
### Authoring
- Fill in all sections of the PR template.
- Include a descriptive title.
- Include a summary of the changes and the impact of the changes.
- **Dependencies**: Be mindful about adding new dependencies and avoid unnecessary dependencies.
    - If a new dependency is required, it should be added to `pyproject.toml`.
- **Tests**: The pull request should include tests for the changes made. Ensure that the tests pass before submitting the pull request. See [Testing](#testing) for more information on how to run tests.
- **Documentation**: If the pull request introduces new features or changes existing ones, it should include documentation updates.
- **CI**: Reviewers will not approve a pull request if the CI build fails. You can close and open PR to re-run CI tests.

### Reviewing
- Be constructive when writing reviews.
- Clearly state what needs to be done before the PR can be approved, if there are any required changes.
- The reviewers reserve the right to reject any PR.

### Merging
- The pull request will be merged once it has been approved by at least one reviewer and the CI build passes.
- After the pull request is merged, close the corresponding issues.

## Local Environment for Development
First, [fork the repository on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/about-forks). Then, clone your fork locally:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:your-username/gatree.git
cd gatree
```

Next, install the development dependencies using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org):
```bash
poetry install
```

All of the project's dependencies should be installed and the project should be ready for further development.
