  abstract={The induction of decision trees is a widely-used approach to build classification models that guarantee high performance and expressiveness. Since a recursive-partitioning strategy guided for some splitting criterion is commonly used to induce these classifiers, overfitting, attribute selection bias, and instability to small training set changes are well-known problems in them. Other approaches, such as incremental induction, classifier ensembles, and the global search in the decision-tree-space, have been implemented to overcome these problems. In particular, metaheuristics such as simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, genetic programming, and ant colony optimization have been used to induce compact and accurate decision trees. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of the use of single-solution-based metaheuristics and swarm and evolutionary computation algorithms to build decision trees as classification models. We outline the decision-tree-induction process components and detail the existing literature studies on metaheuristic-based approaches to building these classifiers. Several timelines showing the chronological order in which these approaches were introduced in the literature are included. A summary analysis of these studies is also conducted, focusing on their internal components and experimental studies. This work provides a useful reference point for future research in this field.}
